# Preparing for coding interviews together, in English

![a binary tree logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Complete_binary.svg/200px-Complete_binary.svg.png)

Essentially this is an English speaking club, but with solving coding problems. Our meetings have no structure so far, we just use Leetcode, Hackerrank, and the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book. That simple. We'll get more organized a bit later.

We are a friendly community, but If you'd like we could simulate a real-world whiteboard interview, including:

- Judgemental stares at you for minor typos and missing semicolons
- Condescending remarks about your answers
- Asking you impossibly hard questions and pretending we didn't have to decipher available solutions for two days beforehand

Joking, don't be stressed too much. Just say hello, introduce yourself, and start geeking out.

The meetup itself is free, but we meet at the Kocherga anticafe in Moscow (https://kocherga-club.ru/), which means each of us pays for the time spent there: 2.5 rubles per minute, it's 150 rubles per hour. They have free coffee and cookies though, and a wonderful nerdy atmosphere, you'll love it I promise. And they have VR btw.

2. Actually solve a couple of entry level problems to get comfortable with the interface
3. Install a dictionary on your phone and don't hesitate to use it

## Target language

You can also focus on practicing in your target language first. For example:

- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python
- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp
- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript

[CTCI](#CTCI) 17.24: max submatrix: given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, write code to find the submatrix with the largest possible sum.

## 2019-10-13

We gave old problems to newcomers and just hung out discussing random topics including gradient descent, react, soft skills, annoyance of the [SettingWithCopyWarning](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/) and it's [false negatives](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/9767).

## 2019-10-06

We had many newcomers, so we had a lot of conversations and mostly solved old problems. My unsolicited advice to students is to not work during first two years of education.

## 2019-09-29

We had a short an unexciting conversation about running processes as root in docker containers.

We started with [trapping-rain-water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) and [shuffle-an-array](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-an-array/) once again with new participants. Then solved a number of easy problems including:

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/  
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/  
https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/  

## 2019-09-22

## 2019-09-15

Discussed streams in java 8, decision trees for regression, and other random topics.

[CTCI](#CTCI) 16.23:

> Rand7 from Rand5: Implement a method rand7() given rand5(). That is, given a method that generates a random number between 0 and 4 (inclusive), write a method that generates a random number between 0 and 6 (inclusive).

Tried to decipher this problem for analytics position:

> Calculate subscription to refund conversion rate with a 1 day conversion window applied. Group by subscription date and apply 7 days rolling average.

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/

## 2019-09-08

We decided to start with an easy problem we had last time, namely [is-subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/), and Kate confused it with the [is-substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/) and implemented the [Knuth–Morris–Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth–Morris–Pratt_algorithm) algorithm right away.

Meanwhile we had a discussion about a product analytics job interview. And unrelated topics.

https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-an-array/  

Homework: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/

## 2019-09-01

We can't have enough of the [trapping-rain-water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) problem. We discussed both quadratic and linear time solutions after introducing it to newcomers.

https://leetcode.com/problems/surface-area-of-3d-shapes/  
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/  

We briefly discussed normal forms. And tried to start a conversation about the REST architecture at the very end, but it's a huge topic, and everyone has different perspectives.

## 2019-08-25

https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/

Talked about a friend of a friend who had enough discipline to get thoroughly prepared for the google interview process and now works at the headquoters in Switzerland.

## 2019-08-18

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/

A discussion of the Big O notation. And a small group of people showed off their knowledge of haskell and monads to each other.

## 2019-08-11

Turns out the [trapping-rain-water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) problem is not as easy as it seems. Most of us managed to write a bad non-linear solution, but there's a good one: [solutions/trapping-rain-water.clj](solutions/trapping-rain-water.clj).

A group of people discussed the following big question: how does pagination work? How to implement it with and without sql? Why offset+limit is slow and what to use instead? Spoiler: keyset pagination.

## 2019-08-04

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/  
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/, https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/  
https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/  

## 2019-07-28

We spent most of the time introducing ourselves and talking. Then a group of people started helping a newbie with python, and others opened the season with solving the following:

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/ — the in-place variant  
https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/
